I am in the first year of my master studies at the WrocÅ‚aw university of Science and Technology. I study Automatics and Control Engineering at the Faculty of Electronics.  I graduated first degree as an Automatics and control engineer. My engineer specialization is Computer systems for industrial systems management. My master specialization is Information Technologies in Automation Systems. I personally define my skills as "Double Full Stack Developer", because I'm can programming starting from microchips (embedded) through backend services ending with frontend services.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Face Lecture service. It helps me learn more about webservices and related technologies.
- ðŸŒ± In the near future I'd like to learn about Containerization, then Machine Learnig and mobile technologies like Flutter.
- âš¡ Fun fact: All languages travels with speed of sound, only sign language travels with speed of light :)
