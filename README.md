## About me:
I am in the first year of my master studies at the Wrocław university of Science and Technology. I study Automatics and Control Engineering at the Faculty of Electronics.  I graduated first degree as an Automatics and control engineer. My engineer specialization is Robotics. My master specialization is Information Technologies in Automation Systems. I personally define my skills as "Double Full Stack Developer", because I'm programming starting from microchips (embedded) through backend services ending with frontend services.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my master thesis: Plant disease recognition using deep neural networks using Python, Keras (TesorFlow).
- 🌱 In the near future I'd like to learn more about mobile technologies like Flutter.
- ⚡ Fun fact: All languages travels with speed of sound, only sign language travels with speed of light :)
